### Welcome to the Fizz Buzz application!

#### The intention of this app is to allow a user to increment or decrement a counter, and evaluate whether or not the counter value is divisible by 3, 5, or both. When divisible by 3, "Fizz" is displayed. When divisible by 5, "Buzz" is displayed. When divisible by both, "FizzBuzz" is displayed.
